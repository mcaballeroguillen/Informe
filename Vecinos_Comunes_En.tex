This method was used  \cite{newman2001clustering} in the study of collaboration networks, showing a positive correlation between the number of common neighbors and the probability that two scientists will collaborate in the future.  It concluded that the probability of collaboration between scientists as a function of their number of mutual acquaintances in the network is strongly positively correlated.
